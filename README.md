# AIcrowd-Motor-Insurance-Market-Simulation
 In this challenge, you will act as an insurance company, where you build a pricing model and compete against other players (other insurance companies) for profit. In other words, the player that maximises competitive profit is the winner.  The market in this challenge will be a cheapest-wins market. That means every insurance company offers every customer an annual premium price, and the customer will always pick the company that offers the cheapest price to them (e.g., using a price comparison website).  In order to create your pricing model, you are given historical insurance data: 60K real historical car insurance policies for 4 consecutive years. Each policy concerns 1 vehicle, its drivers and an accident history over 4 years. This data has been provided by a large car insurance provider in a European country and is a uniform sample for their entire portfolio.  You are asked to produce a model to price contracts for incoming policies for the 5th year.  The company that makes the most profit in this market, wins the challenge
